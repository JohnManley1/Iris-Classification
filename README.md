# Iris-Classification ðŸŒº  
This is my first machine learning project: classifying Iris flower species using the classic Iris dataset. The goal was to learn the ML workflow, from exploring the data to training, evaluating, and comparing different models, all within a single Jupyter notebook.


## Project Overview:
This mini project introduces core concepts in machine learning and data science. It includes:
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
*  Model training and testing
*  Model comparison and tuning

The work is documented in a single Jupyter Notebook for clarity and reproducibility.

## What I Accomplished
Explored the Iris dataset through pairwise scatter plots, box plots, and a correlation matrix  
Trained and evaluated four ML models:
1. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
2. Logistic Regression
3. Decision Tree
4. Random Forest

Performed model comparison based on accuracy
Experimented with hyperparameter tuning (e.g., SVM's C value)

## Skills Developed
* Data visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn
* Hands-on experience with the Scikit-learn ML pipeline
* Applied cross-validation and model tuning
* Improved project organization and documentation practices
